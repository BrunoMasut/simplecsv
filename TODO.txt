- do we need to need to handle \\r \\n \\b  \\t and other special characters
- need to add examples
- need to flesh out manual a TON
- need to add programmatic CSV configuration
- some way to divide up CsvProcessor
- some way to handle a version column at the end of the row?
	- no data, only header
	- specify the version in the name of the column
- pass in an optional Callable<T> which creates the entities if you can't force the public constructor
