2.2: 9/20/2017
	* Some small changes around logging and serializable parse-errors.

2.1: 12/30/2016
	* Sorry for the changes here but this is cleaner.

1.5: 12/22/2016
	* NOTE: should have been 2.0 given the API changes
	* Refactored to support get/is/set methods as well as field.
	* BROKE Converter API to switch to a FieldInfo instead of a field and to make it generic.  Required for method support.
	* RENAMED CsvField to be CsvColumn to better line up with using fields and methods.  Deprecated CsvField.
	* Added a generic parameter to ColumnInfo for the column type it provides information for.

1.4: 8/2/2016
	* Added RowValidator to validate an entity parsed from a CSV line.

1.3: 8/2/2016

	* Added a couple more ParseError ErrorType enum values.

1.2: 6/2/2016
	* Changed the Converter.stringToJava() method to include the line-position for better error messages.
	* Added a CASE_SENSITIVE and NEEDS_QUOTES flags to the BooleanConverter.  It now is case-insensitive by default.
	* Better processing of enum fields.
	* Exposed the BufferedReaderLineCounter class to be used externally to track line numbers.

1.1: 1/22/2016
	* Fixed a problem with the Date converter and multiple dates per item.

0.8: 9/13/2015
	* Renamed CsvField.required to be mustNotBeBlank to be more explicit.

	* Improved test coverage.

0.7: 8/31/2015
	* Fixed the errors from line problems.
	* Changed the way the header-validation is set from argument to .withHeaderValidation(...).
	* Changed the way the first-line-header is set from argument to .withFirstLineHeader(...).
	* Added support for column-name-matcher to match column names using external business logic.
	* Added support for flexible column name ordering based on the header order.
	* Added support for ignoring unknown columns in the data.
	* Fixed the line numbers specified in the errors.

0.6: 12/3/2014
	* Fixed the handling of subclasses.
	* Fixed the registering of class converters.
	* Added with...() type methods.
	* Added manual and auto-config and better Spring wiring setup.

0.5: 11/26/2014
	* Added alwaysTrim to Converter and CsvProcessor.
	* Tweaked the error output.
